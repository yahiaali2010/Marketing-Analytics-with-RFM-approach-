I understand and respect your decision to gather some feedback from me and my cohorts as you make a decision regarding Joy’s new marketing plan. I’ve read up on the case recently, and I think you’ll find this analysis addresses your major concerns. Specifically, this memo offers an overview of Joy’s pressing problems and provides some marketing strategies for addressing these problems.


Problems
According to the attached documents, it is clear that 50% of the Joy restaurant customers have not purchased very recently during the year and half period. Thirty three percent of them are very recent, while 17% of them are not very recent. Additionally, the frequency and monetary distributions indicate that customers tend not to return and not to spend a lot of money. It is imperative for the Marketing Department to initiate campaigns with the goal of making customers return, purchase more often, and buy more every time they purchase.


Analysis Model
The goal of the marketing analyst is to find an optimal solution of customer that should be targeted in a given marketing campaign in order to maximize profitability. The marketing team is using the recency-frequency-monetary value (RFM) framework which is an analytical tool that can be used in combination with descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.
Simultaneously, the analyst tends to identify those RFM segments that are not worth pursuing either due to unprofitability or due to insufficient campaign budgets. Several linear programming models are developed, each will focus specifically on recency, frequency, and monetary value. 

Each LP model is formulated as a 0-1value to identify the category of customers to be reached. In addition, each case is formulated as a continuous LP model, which seeks to identify the percentage of each customers category to be reached. 


LP Model for the Recency Dimension
These parameters are calculated via the RFM Excel template. Using previously recorded data of customer responses from past campaigns, the model will predict the probability that a customer in a given recency group will make a purchase. Then the customer response rates (pi) can be assigned a value of 1 by simply assuming that the customer will respond to the campaign. 

the final solution for this case. As shown, the company should only select customers of recency 2 and 3 for future promotional efforts. This solution generates net revenue of $177,446. This solution indicates a required budget allocation of only $4,753 compared with the maximum available budget of $13,000. The binary requirement for the decision variables indicates that the company must either reach all customers in a certain recency group. 
The solution suggests that the company should reach 100% of the customers with recency 2 and 3 and 96% of the customers with recency 1. This solution will fully utilize the $13,000 budget and provide net revenue of $203,798.


LP Model for the Frequency Dimension
This case focuses on the frequency value for each customer. As showing in attached document, the company should only select customers of recency 1 and 3 for future promotional efforts. This solution generates net revenue of $166,958. This solution indicates a required budget allocation of only $12,351 compared with the maximum available budget of $13,000. The binary requirement for the decision variables indicates that the company must reach all customers in groups 1 or 3. 
The solution suggests that the company should reach 100% of the customers with recency 1 and 3 and 97% of the customers with recency 2. This solution will fully utilize the $13,000 budget and provide net revenue of $193,626.


LP Model for the Monetary Value Dimension
This case focuses on the monetary value for each customer. As shown in attached document, the final solution of this case is the company should only select customers of recency 2 and 3 for future promotional efforts. This solution generates net revenue of $205,634. This solution indicates a required budget allocation of only $11,592 compared with the maximum available budget of $13,000. 
The solution suggests that the company should reach 100% of the customers with recency 2 and 3 and 81% of the customers with recency 1. This solution will fully utilize the $13,000 budget and provide net revenue of $207,748.



Optimal Solutions
The goal of this marketing analyst plan is not only to identify those valuable customers with higher RFM scores that Joy restaurant should be targeting through its new marketing campaign in order to maximize profitability. Simultaneously, the analyst did identify those customer categories that are not worth pursuing either due to unprofitability or due to insufficient operation budgets. Several linear programming models are offered, each with a specific focus on recency, frequency, and monetary value. Therefore, the Analysis team recommend that the new marketing campaign should focus on customers who visits our restaurant more frequently and spend average amount of money. As this type of customer generates the highest earning for us. At general level, the new developed marketing plan should focuses on methods to encourage our customers to return more frequent, and to spend more money on our services.
